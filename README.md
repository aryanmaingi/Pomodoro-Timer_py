### Introduction
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application automates the process, allowing you to focus on your tasks and take breaks at the right intervals.

### Features

- **Work Sessions**: Initiates a 25-minute timer to focus on work.

- **Short Breaks**: Automatically starts a 5-minute break after each work session.

- **Long Breaks**: After every four work sessions, a 20-minute long break is triggered.

- **Reset Functionality**: Allows you to reset both the timer and session count at any time.

- **Progress Tracking**: Displays a checkmark (âœ“) for every completed work session, helping you track your productivity visually.
