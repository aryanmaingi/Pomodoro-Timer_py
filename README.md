Introduction
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application automates the process, allowing you to focus on your tasks and take breaks at the right intervals.

Features
Work Session: The timer starts with a 25-minute work session.
Short Break: After each work session, a 5-minute short break is initiated.
Long Break: Every 4 work sessions (after 2 hours), a 20-minute long break is triggered.
Reset: You can reset the timer and the session count at any time.
Visual Feedback: The application displays a checkmark (âœ“) for each completed work session, providing a visual indication of your progress.
